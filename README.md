### Code guidelines
1. Indent with Tab
2. 1 empty line within a function, 2 empty lines between function
3. Use *trait(s)* to name any or all of the 8 value `strength, agility, intelligence, wisdom, luck, vitality, endurance, dexterity`
4. Use *ability(ies)* to name any or all of the 4 value `passive1, passive2, active1, active2`
5. Use *stat(s)* as a generic term for any or all the characteristics of a hero (traits, abilities, HP, MP, stamina, etc)
6. A function should support all realms, except if contracts differs across realms
7. All hardcoded addresses should be [CheckSummed](https://ethsum.netlify.app/)
8. Use `logging`, not `print`
9. No other third-party libraries (if really needed, please explain why in the PR)
10. A short & meaningful comment is better than a long & unfathomable documentation
